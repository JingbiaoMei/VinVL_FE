When using more than one image per GPU you may encounter an out-of-memory (OOM) error if your GPU does not have sufficient memory. If this happens, you can reduce SOLVER.IMS_PER_BATCH (for training) or TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH (for inference). For training, you must also adjust the learning rate and schedule length according to the linear scaling rule. See for example: https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/configs/getting_started/tutorial_1gpu_e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN.yaml#L14

/home/jm2245/virt/vin/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/distributed/launch.py:178: FutureWarning: The module torch.distributed.launch is deprecated
and will be removed in future. Use torchrun.
Note that --use_env is set by default in torchrun.
If your script expects `--local_rank` argument to be set, please
change it to read from `os.environ['LOCAL_RANK']` instead. See
